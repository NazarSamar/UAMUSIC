# UAMUSIC
This is a long promo landing page with many animations and effects by Nazar Samardak.

WebSite consists of 5 main sections:
  'home' - section with main photo and button 'read more'.
  'history' - section with history and icons.
  'albums'- section with covers of albums and some information about them. Each photo has own hovering method.
  'artists' - section with slider that contains photos of artists and text with name of artist.
  'contact me' - section with a form containing 'Name', 'Email', 'Phone', 'City' and 'Message' fields. All fields are required. Before user     want to submit he have to fill all fields. Also this form contain 'contact infrormation' with 'city','phone','email' and links to my       social media pages.

Landing page has a navbar with links to 4 sections of the page. If user has Ipad or phone, the navbar will transform into small burger menu. 
The page contains a footer with 4 titles and icons in title 'contact' with repeating information from form.
In this project I used html5, css4, javascript, bootstrap4 and MDB.
